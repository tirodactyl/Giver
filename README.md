#Giver

Rewriting some Rails functionality to deepen my understanding of the framework.

Includes:
- Router and Route classes using Regex to run methods in the appropriate controller
- Controller renders template and builds appropriate HTTP response
- Robust parameter parsing from HTTP request
- Adding and retrieving cookies during processing
